# TypeSpeedWebApp
ASP.NET Web App for measuring your type-speed in words per minute. Project was made with C# in using Visual Studio's ASP.NET development.

Download and try running this for yourself! Measures your typing pace in words per minute according to the completion of various snippets 
taken from the web (using a quick python scraper I wrote).

This project was used as a great learning experience in ASP .NET applications and allowed me to get comfortable with using C#.
